<p>In this tutorial, we will explore how to analyze urban community gardening distribution across different boroughs using R and spatial data analysis techniques. We will use the <code>sf</code>, <code>tidyverse</code>, and <code>ggplot2</code> libraries to load, clean, and visualize the required data. Let’s begin by setting up the environment and loading the necessary libraries.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="converting-multi-part-geometries-to-single-part-and-creating-a-leaflet-map">Converting Multi-Part Geometries to Single-Part and Creating a Leaflet Map</h4>
<p>This code snippet performs two main tasks: first, it converts the multi-part geometry columns of the garden_data_sf sf object into single-point geometries; secondly, it creates an interactive leaflet map displaying markers at each garden location.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-1-converting-multi-part-geometries-to-single-part">Step 1: Converting Multi-Part Geometries to Single-Part</h4>
<p>To ensure that our subsequent analyses or visualizations work correctly, especially when dealing with specific functions like clustering or distance calculations, it’s often beneficial to have single-part geometries instead of multi-part ones. Here, we convert the multi-geometry column of the garden_data_sf data frame into separate single-point geometries using the st_cast() function.</p>
