Let’s begin by installing and loading the required packages if you haven’t already.

In this example, we use an Excel file named ‘Geography Table_Data.World.xlsx’ downloaded from (https://data.world/glx/geography-table). Adjust the path accordingly for your local files.\n\n# Read data from Excel file\nGeography &lt;- read_xlsx(\"C:/Users/Zobaer Ahmed/Documents/Zobaer_github_page/portfolio/data/Geography Table_Data.World.xlsx\")\n\n# Display summary of loaded data (if needed delete the \"#\" sign)\n# summary(Geography)\n\nNext, we will display a collapsible tree representing the hierarchical structure of continents, types, and countries using the collapsibleTree() function. Click any node and see the magic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further customize the tree, we can calculate the number of countries per continent and type, then add these counts as attributes for each node. This allows us to view the count when expanding nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, let’s demonstrate creating a collapsible tree for organizational structures using a sample dataset.

    "text": "In this tutorial, we will explore how to analyze urban community gardening distribution across different boroughs using R and spatial data analysis techniques. We will use the sf, tidyverse, and ggplot2 libraries to load, clean, and visualize the required data. Let’s begin by setting up the environment and loading the necessary libraries.\n\n# Required Libraries\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\n\n\nWe start by reading the GreenThumb_Garden_Info.csv file containing information about the locations of community gardens and converting the ‘multipolygon’ field to an sf object.\nData source: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/dataset/GreenThumb-Garden-Info/p78i-pat6/data\n\n\n\nNext, we load the borough boundaries shapefile, transform its Coordinate Reference System (CRS), and perform a spatial join with the garden data.\n\n# Load the borough shapefile and transform the CRS\nborough_shapefile &lt;- st_read('C:/Users/Zobaer Ahmed/Documents/Zobaer_github_page/portfolio/shapefile/Borough Boundaries/geo_export_2097f264-292b-4741-b4bd-9b58f6a775b2.shp')\n\nReading layer `geo_export_2097f264-292b-4741-b4bd-9b58f6a775b2' from data source `C:\\Users\\Zobaer Ahmed\\Documents\\Zobaer_github_page\\portfolio\\shapefile\\Borough Boundaries\\geo_export_2097f264-292b-4741-b4bd-9b58f6a775b2.shp' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 5 features and 4 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -74.25559 ymin: 40.49613 xmax: -73.70001 ymax: 40.91553\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS84(DD)\n\nborough_shapefile &lt;- st_transform(borough_shapefile, crs = st_crs(garden_data_sf))\n\n# Perform spatial join\njoined_data &lt;- st_join(borough_shapefile, garden_data_sf, join = st_intersects)\n\n\n\n\nNow, let us calculate the number of gardens present in each borough and merge the result back into the shapefile.\n\n# Count the number of gardens in each borough\nborough_garden_count &lt;- joined_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(boro_name.x) %&gt;%\n  summarise(count = n()) \n\n# Convert the garden count to a regular data frame\nborough_garden_count_df &lt;- as.data.frame(borough_garden_count)\n\n# Merge the count data back into the borough shapefile\nborough_shapefile &lt;- borough_shapefile %&gt;%\n  left_join(borough_garden_count_df, by = c(\"boro_name\" = \"boro_name.x\"))\n\n\n\n\nNow, we create maps illustrating the distribution of gardens across different boroughs along with their respective counts.\n\n# Calculate the centroids of each borough for labeling\ncentroids &lt;- st_centroid(borough_shapefile)\n\nWarning: st_centroid assumes attributes are constant over geometries\n\n# Extract coordinates for labels\nborough_labels &lt;- data.frame(st_coordinates(centroids))\n\n# Add borough names to the labels data frame\nborough_labels$boro_name &lt;- borough_shapefile$boro_name\n\n# Plot the map with borough names\nggplot(data = borough_shapefile) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = count), color = 'black') +\n  geom_text(data = borough_labels, aes(X, Y, label = boro_name), check_overlap = TRUE, nudge_y = 0.02) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c() +\n  labs(title = 'Distribution of Gardens Across Different Boroughs',\n       fill = 'Number of Gardens') +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis code generates a base map showing the borough shapes filled with white colors and outlines drawn in black. The red dots represent the location of individual community gardens overlaid on top of the borough boundaries. This plot aims to display the overall spatial distribution of gardens within the study area.\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = borough_shapefile, fill = 'white', color = 'black') +\n  geom_sf(data = garden_data_sf, color = \"red\", size = 0.5, alpha = 0.6) +\n  labs(title = \"Spatial Density of Gardens\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following code creates a thematic map where each borough shape is filled according to the number of gardens it contains. Additionally, individual garden points are shown as transparent red dots.

    "text": "In this tutorial, we will explore how to analyze urban community gardening distribution across different boroughs using R and spatial data analysis techniques. We will use the sf, tidyverse, and ggplot2 libraries to load, clean, and visualize the required data. Let’s begin by setting up the environment and loading the necessary libraries.\n\n# Required Libraries\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\n\n\nWe start by reading the GreenThumb_Garden_Info.csv file containing information about the locations of community gardens and converting the ‘multipolygon’ field to an sf object.\nData source: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/dataset/GreenThumb-Garden-Info/p78i-pat6/data\n\n\n\nNext, we load the borough boundaries shapefile, transform its Coordinate Reference System (CRS), and perform a spatial join with the garden data.\n\n# Load the borough shapefile and transform the CRS\nborough_shapefile &lt;- st_read('C:/Users/Zobaer Ahmed/Documents/Zobaer_github_page/portfolio/shapefile/Borough Boundaries/geo_export_2097f264-292b-4741-b4bd-9b58f6a775b2.shp')\n\nReading layer `geo_export_2097f264-292b-4741-b4bd-9b58f6a775b2' from data source `C:\\Users\\Zobaer Ahmed\\Documents\\Zobaer_github_page\\portfolio\\shapefile\\Borough Boundaries\\geo_export_2097f264-292b-4741-b4bd-9b58f6a775b2.shp' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 5 features and 4 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -74.25559 ymin: 40.49613 xmax: -73.70001 ymax: 40.91553\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS84(DD)\n\nborough_shapefile &lt;- st_transform(borough_shapefile, crs = st_crs(garden_data_sf))\n\n# Perform spatial join\njoined_data &lt;- st_join(borough_shapefile, garden_data_sf, join = st_intersects)\n\n\n\n\nNow, let us calculate the number of gardens present in each borough and merge the result back into the shapefile.\n\n# Count the number of gardens in each borough\nborough_garden_count &lt;- joined_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(boro_name.x) %&gt;%\n  summarise(count = n()) \n\n# Convert the garden count to a regular data frame\nborough_garden_count_df &lt;- as.data.frame(borough_garden_count)\n\n# Merge the count data back into the borough shapefile\nborough_shapefile &lt;- borough_shapefile %&gt;%\n  left_join(borough_garden_count_df, by = c(\"boro_name\" = \"boro_name.x\"))\n\n\n\n\nNow, we create maps illustrating the distribution of gardens across different boroughs along with their respective counts.\n\n# Calculate the centroids of each borough for labeling\ncentroids &lt;- st_centroid(borough_shapefile)\n\nWarning: st_centroid assumes attributes are constant over geometries\n\n# Extract coordinates for labels\nborough_labels &lt;- data.frame(st_coordinates(centroids))\n\n# Add borough names to the labels data frame\nborough_labels$boro_name &lt;- borough_shapefile$boro_name\n\n# Plot the map with borough names\nggplot(data = borough_shapefile) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = count), color = 'black') +\n  geom_text(data = borough_labels, aes(X, Y, label = boro_name), check_overlap = TRUE, nudge_y = 0.02) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c() +\n  labs(title = 'Distribution of Gardens Across Different Boroughs',\n       fill = 'Number of Gardens') +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis code generates a base map showing the borough shapes filled with white colors and outlines drawn in black.
